# Dosu codebase audit

This is the full procedure for the **codebase audit** referenced from [../SKILL.md](../SKILL.md).
The goal: inspect the current repository and decide, with evidence, whether Dosu can help the
user by creating or refreshing four docs. Write the result to `.dosu/audit.json`
(see [audit-findings-schema.md](audit-findings-schema.md)), then tell the user to run
`dosu audit` so the Dosu CLI can ask them which docs to generate and open a PR.

You (the coding agent) only do the **triage** here — you have the live working tree, so you can
tell what exists, what's stale, and whether there's enough signal. You do **not** write the docs
themselves; Dosu cloud generates them and opens the PR after the user picks via `dosu audit`.

## When to run this

Run when the user asks Dosu to audit the repo, asks "what can Dosu do for this codebase?", or
asks to set up / refresh their agent docs, README, architecture doc, or dependency doc.

## The four doc types

| `task` | File | When Dosu can help |
|---|---|---|
| `generate-agents-md` | `AGENTS.md` | Missing, or present but stale/thin given the repo's structure, commands, and conventions. |
| `refresh-readme` | `README.md` | Present but **outdated** — references removed scripts/deps, missing setup steps, or describes features that no longer match the code. |
| `generate-architecture-md` | `architecture.md` | **Missing AND** there is genuinely enough structure to describe (multiple modules/services, clear layering). Do not recommend for a tiny or single-file repo. |
| `generate-deps-md` | `deps.md` | Missing, or present but out of sync with the actual dependency manifests. |

## Rules

- **Be evidence-based.** Prefer direct repo evidence over inference. Cite concrete `evidence`:
  file paths (and `path:line` where useful), manifest entries, config keys.
- **Gate `architecture.md` strictly.** Only set `can_help: true` for `generate-architecture-md`
  when the repo is large/structured enough that a useful architecture doc can be written. When in
  doubt, set `can_help: false`, `action: "skip"`, and a `rationale` saying why.
- **Distinguish status from action.** `status` is what you found (`missing` / `outdated` /
  `present_ok`); `action` is what Dosu should do (`create` / `update` / `skip`).
- **Include every type you assessed**, even when `can_help` is `false`, so the CLI can explain
  what it skipped and why.
- **Make `rationale` specific** — it is forwarded to Dosu cloud as generation guidance. "README's
  install section references a `make bootstrap` target that no longer exists" beats "README looks
  old."
- **Don't write the docs.** Producing the actual files is Dosu cloud's job, triggered by the user
  through `dosu audit`.

## Use Dosu MCP for org knowledge

Before finalizing recommendations, use the Dosu MCP tools to pull organization knowledge that
should inform the docs (architecture decisions, naming, conventions, prior docs):

1. `init_knowledge` — always call first to get task-relevant context from the knowledge base.
2. `search_documentation` / `ask` — check whether the org already documents the architecture,
   dependencies, or agent conventions elsewhere. If it does, factor that into `status`/`rationale`
   (e.g. an existing architecture doc in Dosu may mean a repo `architecture.md` should mirror it).

If no Dosu deployment is connected (only public-library tools are available), skip the MCP step
and rely on repo evidence alone; note in the `rationale` that org knowledge wasn't consulted.

## Procedure

1. **Identify the repo.** Get the remote and slug:
   ```bash
   git config --get remote.origin.url
   ```
   Parse `owner/name` from it for `repo.slug`. If there is no GitHub remote, tell the user the
   audit needs a GitHub repo connected to Dosu and stop.

2. **Inspect the working tree** for each doc type. Useful starting points:
   ```bash
   ls -a
   # existing docs (any casing)
   ls AGENTS.md README.md architecture.md ARCHITECTURE.md deps.md DEPS.md docs/ 2>/dev/null
   # dependency manifests
   ls package.json pyproject.toml requirements*.txt go.mod Cargo.toml Gemfile pom.xml build.gradle 2>/dev/null
   ```
   - **AGENTS.md** — does it exist? If yes, is it consistent with the current build/test commands,
     directory layout, and contribution conventions? Read it and compare against `package.json`
     scripts / Makefile / CI config.
   - **README.md** — read it. Are the setup/build/run steps still accurate? Do referenced scripts,
     commands, env vars, and features still exist in the code? Mark `outdated` only with evidence.
   - **architecture.md** — does it exist? Is the repo structured enough to warrant one? Look at the
     top-level layout, number of modules/services, and whether there's a clear separation worth
     documenting.
   - **deps.md** — does it exist? If yes, does it match the actual manifests/lockfiles? If missing,
     are there real dependencies worth documenting?

3. **Consult Dosu MCP** (see above) to enrich and cross-check.

4. **Write `.dosu/audit.json`** following [audit-findings-schema.md](audit-findings-schema.md).
   Create the `.dosu/` directory if needed. Write one `items` entry per type you assessed.

5. **Tell the user to run the CLI.** End with a short message, e.g.:

   > Audit complete — I wrote `.dosu/audit.json`. Run `dosu audit` to choose which docs Dosu
   > should generate; it will open a PR with the ones you pick.

   Do not attempt to generate or commit the docs yourself.
